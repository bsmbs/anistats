        anistats is an extended statistics tool for AniList

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>

        AniList has a small feature called "Activity". Each time you watch an episode, add something to your planning list, an activity is created. anistats takes adventage of that to count how many episodes you've seen on a specific day.

        <h3>Why it doesn't work?</h3>

        <b>Your profile has to be public for it to work.</b>

        <br>

        Also, you have to add episodes using this little '+' symbol next to the episode count instead of setting it directly from the 'Edit' menu.
       
        <br>

        Let's say you've started a new series yesterday and watched 3 episodes so far. 
        Today, after watching 3 next episodes, you set the episode count directly to '6'. AniList creates an activity saying that you've watched episode 6. anistats counts that as <b>one</b> episode.
        
        <br>
        
        If you click the '+' symbol three times instead, the activity says that you've watched episodes 4-6. anistats sees that correctly as 3 episodes.
